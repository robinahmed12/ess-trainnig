 <!-- 1. How the Web Works -->

You open a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

You type a URL (like www.google.com).

The browser (client) sends a request to the server where the website is stored.

The server sends back files (HTML, CSS, JS).

The browser shows you the page.


<!--  2. Client & Server -->

Client = Your browser (user side) → shows the website.

Server = Powerful computer → stores websites, handles requests.

Example:
You (client) → order pizza → Restaurant (server) → sends pizza back. 

<!-- 3. HTTP & HTTPS -->

HTTP = rules for communication between browser & server.

HTTPS = same, but secure 

Works like a mail service:

GET → ask for info (e.g., open a page).

POST → send info (e.g., submit a form).

 <!-- 4. URL (Website Address) -->

Example:
https://www.example.com:443/about?user=robin#contact

https → Protocol

www.example.com
 → Domain name

:443 → Port (optional, usually hidden)

/about → Path (which page)

?user=robin → Query (extra info)

#contact → Fragment (jump to section)

 <!-- 5. Frontend vs Backend -->

Frontend (Client-side) → What users see (HTML, CSS, JS).

Backend (Server-side) → Hidden logic, databases, authentication.

Example:

Frontend = The pizza menu you see 

Backend = Kitchen where food is prepared 

<!-- 6. DNS (Domain Name System) -->

Converts a domain name into an IP address.

Because computers talk in numbers, not words.

Example:
You type www.google.com → DNS says: “That’s 142.250.190.78” → Browser connects there.

 <!-- 7. Web Languages -->

HTML → Structure (skeleton).

CSS → Styling (clothes).

JavaScript → Interactivity (brain).

 <!-- 8. Cookies, LocalStorage, Session -->

Cookies → Small data saved in browser (login info, preferences).

LocalStorage → Permanent storage in browser.

Session → Temporary storage (clears when browser closes).

 <!-- Super Simple Summary: -->

Web = connection between browser (client) and server.

Uses HTTP/HTTPS to talk.

Frontend = what you see, Backend = hidden logic.

DNS = like phonebook for websites.

HTML, CSS, JS = building blocks of frontend.
